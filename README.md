The campaign smart contract file consist of two contracts, a CampaignFactory contract and the Campaign contract itself, the CampaignFactory is in charge of deploying a new instance of the Campaign contract. The Campaign smart contract has the methods contribute, createRequest, approveRequest and finalizeRequest. Only the manager can create a request to expend the balance of the contract and finalize that request and only the contributors can approve an expend request by voting to approve once per request.
